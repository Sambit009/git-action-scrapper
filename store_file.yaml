    needed ports.
  expertise: Aws
  option_1: The rule that exposes TCP ports 3380-3390 would also publicly expose port
    3389 (RDP) to the entire internet. Write separate rules to only expose the needed
    ports.
  option_2: The first security group rule allows all traffic into this instance. Exposing
    your entire instance to the whole internet leaves the server open to various attacks
    of the other services running on different port numbers.
  option_3: Verify that the AWS account owners actually control the entire CIDR C
    block for 12.228.11.0-255 and these are secured IPs for RDP access into this instance.
  option_4: There are no recommendations to make.
  question: You have four front-end web servers behind a load balancer, which use
    NFS to access another EC2 instance that resizes and stores images for the front-end

    all traffic to pass between each of the five

    Elastic IP addresses and allow all inbound HTTPS traffic.'
  option_2: Front-end web servers should allow HTTPS. Assign another group to all
    of the instances that allows all traffic to pass between instances using that
    group.
  option_3: Create a security group that allows inbound NFS, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic
    from all IP addresses. Apply this group to all of the servers.
  option_4: Create a security group that allows inbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic from
    all IP addresses and apply this to the web servers. Create a second security group
    for the NFS filestore that allows outbound NFS traffic to the private IP range
    of the front-end web servers.
  question: You have a Linux EC2 web server that suddenly is timing out on all HTTP
    requests and your SSH connection attempts are timing out. You notice that it is

  question: What is the best practice for creating a highly available PostgreSQL database
    in RDS that can sustain the loss of a single AWS region?
- correct_answer: Create Read Replicas in other AWS regions. Ensure read operations
    against the database occur on an available Read Replica, and send write operations
    to another region if you need to promote a Read Replica to a standalone database
    if the master is down.
  expertise: Aws
  option_1: PostgreSQL cannot be replicated across regions. Restore the database backups
    from an S3 bucket and repoint your database connections to the new instance.
  option_2: Create Read Replicas in other AWS regions. You can designate a new master
    database from any of the read replicas until the regional failure is resolved.
  option_3: Verify that your instance is configured for Multi-AZ support. Database
    changes will be automatically synced to another region in the event of a failure
    and RDS will automatically select a new master until the regional failure is resolved.
  option_4: Create Read Replicas in other AWS regions. Ensure read operations against
    the database occur on an available Read Replica, and send write operations to
    another region if you need to promote a Read Replica to a standalone database
    if the master is down.
  question: You created a new Linux EC2 instance and installed PostgreSQL but you
    are not able to establish a connection to the server from your local computer.
    What steps do you take to resolve this issue?

    IP address to port 5432. Verify that PostgreSQL is configured to listen to external
    traffic and is bound to the public interface.
  expertise: Aws
  option_1: Create a security group rule that allows all traffic from 0.0.0.0/0. This
    will verify whether or not another rule is denying the traffic.
  option_2: Verify that the assigned security groups allow traffic from your IP address
    to port 5432. Verify that PostgreSQL is configured to listen to external traffic
    and is bound to the public interface.
  option_3: Make sure that you are using an Elastic IP and that it is included within
    the postgresql.conf configuration file.
  option_4: Stop and start the instance. New security group rules will only take effect
    after a restart.
