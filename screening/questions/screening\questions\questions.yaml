    across AWS regions in an active-active architecture?
- ans: option_3
  option_1: All images in the AWS Marketplace incur additional hourly fees in addition
    to the charges from the instance size you select.
  option_2: You can only launch images that were created by other users on your AWS
    account, so you pay only for the instance size you select and the S3 storage costs
    for the base image.
  option_3: Each image has its own pricing that could either be free, or include charges
    for software licensing costs. You will also pay for the instance the image runs
    on
  option_4: All images in the AWS Marketplace contain only open-source software with
    no additional fees and are created by other AWS users. You will pay only for the
    instance size you select.
  question: What does it cost to launch an EC2 instance from the AWS Marketplace?
- ans: option_3
  option_1: The instances created by ECS do not have patches that need to be applied;
    however, you should make sure your containers contain any important security updates.
  option_2: Refresh the cluster with instances built from the latest ECS AMI.
  option_3: ECS clusters do not use EC2 instances.
  option_4: You should not directly manipulate the EC2 instances created by ECS. AWS
    will automatically update these instances.
  question: When using an ECS cluster with EC2 instances, what maintenance tasks should
    you perform on the EC2s?

  option_1: Use the billing dashboard to create a cost budget. Input the max amount
    you want to be charged each month. Any charges that occur over this amount will
    cause AWS to automatically suspend those resources
  option_2: Using the root AWS account, activate IAM access to the billing information
    for the account. Make sure your IAM users have the Billing FullAccessGroup policy.
    Then from the billing dashboard, check the accrued charges once a day.
  option_3: If you are using the AWS free tier, you will have to confirm the usage
    of any service that goes over the AWS free tier limits.
  option_4: Using the root AWS account enable Billing Alerts in the user preferences.
    Then use CloudWatch to create a billing alarm and set a threshold to a specific
    dollar amount for your estimated monthly charges.
  question: When using AWS for research and development ahead of a planned migration,
    how do you prevent unexpected increases or spikes in the billing?
- ans: option_4
  option_1: The primary key should be a partition key of the title field.
  option_2: The primary key should be the title field and the partition key should
    be the genres field.
  option_3: The primary key should be a composite key comprised of a partition key
    on the title field and a sort key on the year field.
  option_4: The primary key should be created as a completely unique value, such a
    sequential numerical list of movie IDs. The partition key should be title field
    for fast lookup.
  question: You are creating a DynamoDB table to store all movies that have been released
    since 1938. Your application will allow users to search by movie title and see
    the details of that film. Given the sample below showing the movie data that you

  option_3: email
  option_4: automated phone call
  question: Which communication channel does SNS not support natively?
- ans: option_4
  option_1: Serverless web applications run within the web browser of the user, so
    you will need to store any data the user changes directly in a database.
  option_2: Lambda only allows you to write functions in JavaScript.
  option_3: Lambda does not use servers, so it can only return the same request to
    every user.
  option_4: Lambda is stateless, so it won’t remember who a user is in between requests.
  question: When designing a serverless web application using Lambda, what key concept
    must you factor into your design?
- ans: option_2
  option_1: CloudTrail
  option_2: CloudFormation

    allows you to script your AWS infrastructure?
- ans: option_2
  option_1: Check the routing tables for the VPC.
  option_2: Verify that the assigned security groups allow TCP port 1433 traffic from
    your current IP address.
  option_3: Check the policies within Windows Firewall.
  option_4: Verify that you are connecting to the instance using a user that is not
    sa.
  question: You created a Windows EC2 instance with a public IP address and installed
    SQL Server. When attempting to connect to SQL Server from SQL Server Enterprise
    Manager on your local computer, the Windows EC2 instance is unable to establish
    a connection to the server. What is the first thing you should check?
- ans: option_1
  option_1: The rule that exposes TCP ports 3380-3390 would also publicly expose port
    3389 (RDP) to the entire internet. Write separate rules to only expose the needed
    ports.
  option_2: The first security group rule allows all traffic into this instance. Exposing
    your entire instance to the whole internet leaves the server open to various attacks
    of the other services running on different port numbers.
  option_3: Verify that the AWS account owners actually control the entire CIDR C
    block for 12.228.11.0-255 and these are secured IPs for RDP access into this instance.
  option_4: There are no recommendations to make.
  question: You are hosting an application configured to stream media to its clients
    on TCP ports 3380-3384, 3386-3388, and 3390. The Inbound tab below shows three
    incoming security group policies attached to this instance. Which policy should
    you use?
  question_img: https://ebazhanov.github.io//linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes/aws//linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes/aws/images/001.png
- ans: option_2
  option_1: 'Assign Elastic IPs to all of the instances and create a group that allows
    all traffic to pass between each of the five

    Elastic IP addresses and allow all inbound HTTPS traffic.'
  option_2: Front-end web servers should allow HTTPS. Assign another group to all
    of the instances that allows all traffic to pass between instances using that
    group.
  option_3: Create a security group that allows inbound NFS, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic
    from all IP addresses. Apply this group to all of the servers.
  option_4: Create a security group that allows inbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic from
    all IP addresses and apply this to the web servers. Create a second security group
    for the NFS filestore that allows outbound NFS traffic to the private IP range
    of the front-end web servers.
  question: You have four front-end web servers behind a load balancer, which use
    NFS to access another EC2 instance that resizes and stores images for the front-end
    application. What security group policies should be assigned to these servers?
  question_img: https://ebazhanov.github.io//linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes/aws//linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes/aws/images/001.png
- ans: option_1
  option_1: Restore the instance from the last AMI image. System status checks indicate
    that the filesystem on the instance is corrupted.
  option_2: Stop and start the instance. This will move the instance to another host.
  option_3: Contact AWS support. Failing a system status check indicates a failure
    in the underlying hardware and must be addressed by an AWS representative.
  option_4: Reboot the instance. This will stop and start the instance and move it
    to another host.
  question: You have a Linux EC2 web server that suddenly is timing out on all HTTP
    requests and your SSH connection attempts are timing out. You notice that it is
    failing the system status check in the EC2 console. What action should you take?

  option_2: Use Storage Gateway.
  option_3: Sync files directly to S3 with the AWS CLI.
  option_4: Use the RDS console to force a reboot of the database instance so that
    the primary server becomes the master server again.
  question: You have several on-premise servers and would like to store your offsite
    backups on AWS. What fully managed backup service can you use to ship your backups
    to AWS?
  question_img: https://ebazhanov.github.io//linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes/aws//linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes/aws/images/001.png
- ans: option_4
  option_1: PostgreSQL cannot be replicated across regions. Restore the database backups
    from an S3 bucket and repoint your database connections to the new instance.
  option_2: Create Read Replicas in other AWS regions. You can designate a new master
    database from any of the read replicas until the regional failure is resolved.
  option_3: Verify that your instance is configured for Multi-AZ support. Database
    changes will be automatically synced to another region in the event of a failure
    and RDS will automatically select a new master until the regional failure is resolved.
  option_4: Create Read Replicas in other AWS regions. Ensure read operations against
    the database occur on an available Read Replica, and send write operations to
    another region if you need to promote a Read Replica to a standalone database
    if the master is down.
  question: What is the best practice for creating a highly available PostgreSQL database
    in RDS that can sustain the loss of a single AWS region?
  question_img: https://ebazhanov.github.io//linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes/aws//linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes/aws/images/001.png
- ans: option_2
  option_1: Create a security group rule that allows all traffic from 0.0.0.0/0. This
    will verify whether or not another rule is denying the traffic.
  option_2: Verify that the assigned security groups allow traffic from your IP address
    to port 5432. Verify that PostgreSQL is configured to listen to external traffic
    and is bound to the public interface.
  option_3: Make sure that you are using an Elastic IP and that it is included within
    the postgresql.conf configuration file.
  option_4: Stop and start the instance. New security group rules will only take effect
    after a restart.
  question: You created a new Linux EC2 instance and installed PostgreSQL but you
    are not able to establish a connection to the server from your local computer.
    What steps do you take to resolve this issue?

  question: What does the statement body of this S3 bucket policy do?
  question_img: https://ebazhanov.github.io//linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes/aws//linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes/aws/images/001.png
- ans: option_4
  option_1: Give the new developer the IAM login that is assigned to the development
    team. This IAM user should already include all of the policies that a developer
    would need.
  option_2: Create a IAM user for the new developer. Manually assign policies to the
    new IAM user account.
  option_3: Do not give the new developer access to the AWS console. Using the IAM
    user that is assigned to the development group, generate a new set of access keys
    and label these with the name of the developer.
  option_4: Create a IAM user for the new developer. Assign the new developer the
    a developer group you already created for the other developers.
  question: A new developer has been added to the team and you have been asked to
    provide access to the organization’s AWS account. What is the best practice for
    granting access?
  question_img: https://ebazhanov.github.io//linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes/aws//linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes/aws/images/001.png
- ans: option_1
  option_1: Use the instance storage to serve temporary files that require low I/O
    latency.
  option_2: Use the instance storage to handle files uploaded by your users. Since
    it is more secure than an EBS volume, you can isolate any malicious files from
    infecting your server.
  option_3: Instance storage is faster than EBS volumes, so install the root of the
    operating system on this volume to speed up server performance.
  option_4: Instance storage is a deprecated option for storage and should not be
    used.
  question: When launching an EC2 instance with an instance type that supports instance
    storage, what use case is best for instance storage?
  question_img: https://ebazhanov.github.io//linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes/aws//linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes/aws/images/001.png
- ans: option_1
  option_1: Use Sysprep to shut down the instance during a maintenance window. Create
    an AMI image and place both servers behind Application Load Balancer with sticky
    sessions.
  option_2: Launch a new EC2 with the latest version of Windows Server and install
    the application again. Use Application Load Balancer and sticky sessions to balance
    between both servers.
  option_3: Create a clone of the server using an AMI image and user Application Load
    Balancer to balance the traffic between both instances using sticky sessions.
  option_4: Horizontal scaling is not the best practice in this situation. Increase
    the size of the existing EC2 instance and vertically scale the application.
  question: What’s the best practice for horizontally scaling a legacy ASP.NET web
    application that relies on Active Directory and is currently deployed to a single
    Windows EC2 instance?

    group. You could use this to inspect the network connections of your VPC.
  option_2: It logs all of the network traffic within a VPC except Instance IDs defined
    by LogVpcID and logs it to the CloudWatch FlowLogsGroup log group.
  option_3: It logs all the network traffic going to and from a single EC2 instance
    into the CloudWatch FlowLogsGroup log group. You could use this to inspect suspicious
    network traffic coming into an EC2 instance.
  option_4: It logs all of the DNS requests made by resources within a VPC and logs
    them to the CloudWatch FlowLogsGroup. Use this to diagnose DNS lookup errors within
    your environment.
  question: What does this small section of a CloudFormation template do?

  option_1: All objects within this bucket are assigned public access and could be
    readable or writable by anyone on the internet. Ensure no sensitive data is being
    publicly shared within this bucket.
  option_2: All objects within this bucket are writable, which means that the public
    internet has the ability to upload any file directly to your S3 bucket. Your S3
    bucket could be used to serve malware.
  option_3: Some objects within this bucket are assigned public access. Verify that
    any publicly shared objects within this bucket contain no sensitive data.
  option_4: Objects within this bucket can be made public, if the ACL on that object

  option_2: " $.when( $.get('https://example.com/json-api/students'), $.get('https://example.com/json-api/classes')\
    \ ).done(function(studentRequest, classRequest) { \n// the rest of the code goes\
    \ here \n});\n \n"
  option_3: " $.bind( $.get('https://example.com/json-api/students'), $.get('https://example.com/json-api/classes')\
    \ ).done(function(studentRequest, classRequest) { \n// the rest of the code goes\
    \ here \n});\n \n"
  option_4: " $.ajax('https://example.com/json-api/students', { success: function(studentRequest)\
    \ { $.ajax('https://example.com/json-api/classes', { success: function(classRequest)\
    \ { \n// the rest of the code goes here \n} }); } });\n \n"
  question: Working with AJAX, we may run into situations where a piece of code should
    not be run until after multiple AJAX calls have completed successfully. Say we
    need to call two external services for JSON data (a list of students, and a list
    of classes). And only after retrieving those data will we perform some manipulations
    on a page. What is the preferred way for dealing with this scenario?
- ans: option_1
  option_1: .get() retrieves a DOM element, and can’t be chained, eq() retrieves a
    jQuery object, and can be chained.
  option_2: .get() retrieves a jQuery object, and can’t be chained, eq() retrieves
    a DOM element, and can be chained.
  option_3: .get() retrieves a jQuery object, and is zero-indexed, eq() retrieves
    a DOM element, and is 1-indexed.
  option_4: .get() retrieves a DOM element, and is zero-indexed, eq() retrieves a
    jQuery object, and is 1-indexed.
  question: Given the snippet of HTML below, what is the difference between the two
    lines that follow it?
- ans: option_1
  option_1: " $(this).animate({ top: '+=100', left: '+=100', }, { duration: 600, complete:\
    \ function() { $(this).animate({ top: '-=100', left: '-=100', }, 600) } });\n\
    \ \n"
  option_2: " $(this).animate({ top: '-=100', left: '-=100', }, 600, function() {\
    \ $(this).animate({ top: '+=100', left: '+=100', }, 600) });\n \n"
  option_3: " $(this).animate({ top: '=100', left: '=100', }, { duration: 600, complete:\
    \ function() { $(this).animate({ top: 0, left: 0, }, 600) } });\n \n"
  option_4: " $(this).animate({ top: '100', left: '100', }, 600, function() { $(this).animate({\
    \ top: 0, left: 0, }, 600) });\n \n"
  question: Suppose we want to have a ball created from an HTML element (id=ball)
    move down and to the right from its original location when clicked, and move back
    into its original place when finished. Given a starting point of this, which of
    these snippets would accomplish that goal?
- ans: option_3
  option_1: $('.feedback').hasClass('.success');
  option_2: $.css('.feedback', '.success');
  option_3: $('.feedback').addClass('success');
  option_4: $('.feedback').css('.success');
  question: Given the following CSS and HTML codes below, how could you apply the
    success class to the feedback div?
- ans: option_1
  option_1: tonsOfItems.map(function(item) { $('.message-area--list').append('<li>'+item+'</li>');
    });
  option_2: var tonsOfListItems = tonsOfItems.map(function(item)) { return '<li>'+item+'</li>';
    }); $('.message-area--list').append(tonsOfListItems.join(''));
  option_3: Removing the event handlers with JavaScript will be slower than removing
    them $.each(tonsOfItems, function(idx, item) { $('<li>'+item+'</li>').appendTo($messageList);
    });
  option_4: $.each(tonsOfItems, function(idx, item) { $('.message-area--list').append('<li>'+item+'</li>');
    });
  question: Below is an example page snippet that includes a couple of messages in
    a list, and a code snippet that retrieves a few hundred messages from a API endpoints
    using AJAX. How might we add these items to the page snippet in a way that avoids
    performance problems with DOM insertions?
- ans: option_3
  option_1: jQuery is a bridge between Java and Javascript that makes native apps
    easier to write.
  option_2: jQuery is a plugin for JavaScript that makes database queries easier to
    write.
  option_3: jQuery is a collection of JavaScript functions that makes finding and
    manipulating elements on a page, AJAX, and other things easier.
  option_4: jQuery is a Chrome extension that allows users to create their own extensions
    with just a few lines of JavaScript.
  question: What is jQuery?
- ans: option_4
  option_1: this needs to be wrapped, like $(this), in order to be chained in a plugin.
  option_2: jQuery plugins can’t be safely authored in strict mode.
  option_3: In order to be used by other code, plugins need to be added to the global
    namespace, not wrapped in a function expression.
  option_4: Our plugin should extend jQuery.fn, not jQuery itself.
  question: We want to create a new jQuery plugin called linkUpdater that can be chained
    onto other jQuery selector like a normal plugin. It should update all the links
    in the referenced collection so they open in new windows or tabs. Below is the
    first cut. What is one problem with this plugin?
- ans: option_1
  option_1: Just before the closing body tag, because we want to avoid blocking other
    resources from loading, and we use the ready method to make sure our code fires
    after the DOM is ready
  option_2: Using the highest version number possible because only jQuery 3 and up
    are compatible with Internet Explorer 7
  option_3: In the head tag because we want jQuery available as soon as possible
  option_4: From a CDN because we want to be able to use jQuery online or offline
  question: Generally speaking, when used on a web page, how should jQuery be installed,
    and why?
- ans: option_1
  option_1: $('.btn-primary').hide();
  option_2: $('.btn-primary:visible').not();
  option_3: $('.btn-primary').visibility(false);
  option_4: $('.btn-primary').show(false);
  question: Given the following HTML, how could we make this button disappear from
    the page using jQuery?
- ans: option_1
  option_1: $('header').html() returns the inner HTML of the header. $('header').text()
    returns only the text
  option_2: $('header').html() returns only the HTML tags used, without the text.
    $('header').text() returns only the text
  option_3: $('header').html() strips all HTML from the header. $('header').text()
    always returns an empty string.
  option_4: $('header').html() returns all headers in an HTML document. $('header').text()
    the first line of a text file.
  question: What is the difference between $('header').html() and $('header').text()?
- ans: option_1
  option_1: $.extend
  option_2: $.clone
  option_3: $.fn.extend
  option_4: $.merge
  question: When writing jQuery plugins, we often provide default options that may
    be overridden by the end user. What jQuery function is most useful for this purpose?
- ans: option_1
  option_1: $('button').on('click.myApp', (function() { $('input[type=select]').trigger('click');
    });
  option_2: $('button').on('click', (function() { $('input[type=select]').click());
    });
  option_3: $('button').trigger(function() { $('input[type=select]').click(); });
  option_4: $('button').click(function() { $('input[type=select]').click(); });
  question: There are times when you might want to programmatically trigger an event,
    instead of simply reacting to user input directly. Given this markup, Which choice
    will NOT cause a click event to the select box when the button is clicked?
- ans: option_1
  option_1: $('.animate-me').offset();
  option_2: $('.animate-me').each();
  option_3: $('.animate-me').position();
  option_4: $('.animate-me').offsetParent();
  question: You have an absolutely positioned element inside a relatively positioned
    parent element, and you want to animate that element within its parent element.
    What jQuery function is most useful for finding the initial coordinates of the
    .animate-me?
- ans: option_3
  option_1: jQuery.sub
  option_2: jQuery.ajaxTransport
  option_3: jQuery.Deferred
  option_4: jQuery.proxy
  question: You want to work with AJAX using a Promise-like interface instead of nested
    callback functions. What jQuery API should you use?
- ans: option_1
  option_1: Referring to lists of items, they are 1-indexed (like CSS), not 0-indexed
    (like JavaScript).
  option_2: They don’t return the jQuery object, and cannot be chained.
  option_3: They can return the wrong items if the DOM was recently manipulated.
  option_4: They are not part of CSS, so they don’t get the performance benefits of
    passing through the document.querySelectorAll.
  question: What is tricky about jQuery’s nth- filters (:nth-child, :nth-of-type,
    etc.) relative to other filters?
- ans: option_1
  option_1: " $.get('hhttp://httpbin.org/delay/2')\n.then(function(response) {\n \
    \ // Data from first GET is here as 'response'\n  return $.get('http://httpbin.org/delay/2');\n\
    })\n.then(function(response) {\n  // Data from second GET is here as 'response'\n\
    });\n \n"
  option_2: " $.get('hhttp://httpbin.org/delay/2')\n.catch(function(response) {\n\
    \  // Data from first GET is here as 'response'\n  return $.get('http://httpbin.org/delay/2');\n\
    })\n.done(function(response) {\n  // Data from second GET is here as 'response'\n\
    });\n \n"
  option_3: " $.get('hhttp://httpbin.org/delay/2', function(response1) {\n// Data\
    \ from first GET is here as 'response1'\n\n$.get('http://httpbin.org/delay/2',\
    \ function(response2) {\n// Data from second GET is here as 'response2'\n});\n\
    });\n \n"
  option_4: " $.get('hhttp://httpbin.org/delay/2')\n.then(function(response) {\n \
    \ // Data from first GET is here as 'response'\n  return response;\n})\n.get('http://httpbin.org/delay/2',\
    \ function(response) {\n  // Data from second GET is here as 'response'\n});\n\
    \ \n"
  question: jQuery’s AJAX functions return objects that implement the Promise API.
    As a result, you can chain promises and avoid nested callbacks. What does that
    look like?
- ans: option_2
  option_1: " $(this).animate({\ntop: '-=100',\nleft: '-=100',\n}, 600, function()\
    \ {\n$(this).animate({\ntop: '+=100',\nleft: '+=100',\n}, 600)\n});\n \n"
  option_2: " $(this).animate({\ntop: '+=100',\nleft: '+=100',\n}, {\nduration: 600,\n\
    complete: function() {\n$(this).animate({\ntop: '-=100',\nleft: '-=100',\n}, 600)\n\
    }\n});\n \n"
  option_3: " $(this).animate({\ntop: 100,\nleft: 100,\n}, 600, function() {\n$(this).animate({\n\
    top: 0,\nleft: 0,\n}, 600)\n});\n \n"
  option_4: " $(this).animate({\ntop: 100,\nleft: 100,\n}, {\nduration: 600,\ncomplete:\
    \ function() {\n$(this).animate({\ntop: 0,\nleft: 0,\n}, 600)\n}\n});\n \n"
  question: You want to have a ball that is created from an HTML element (id=ball)
    move down and to the right of its original location when clicked, and move back
    to its original place when finished. What snippet, added to the code below, would
    do this?
- ans: option_2
  option_1: '```html'
  option_2: " $(this).animate({\ntop: '+=100',\nleft: '+=100',\n}, {\nduration: 600,\n\
    complete: function() {\n$(this).animate({\ntop: '-=100',\nleft: '-=100',\n}, 600)\n\
    }\n});\n \n"
  option_3: " $(this).animate({\ntop: 100,\nleft: 100,\n}, 600, function() {\n$(this).animate({\n\
    top: 0,\nleft: 0,\n}, 600)\n});\n \n"
  option_4: " $(this).animate({\ntop: 100,\nleft: 100,\n}, {\nduration: 600,\ncomplete:\
    \ function() {\n$(this).animate({\ntop: 0,\nleft: 0,\n}, 600)\n}\n});\n \n"
  question: The way .wrap() works is sometimes misunderstood. Given the DOM and jQuery
    snippets below, what does the modified DOM snippet look like?
- ans: option_3
  option_1: $('.quotes + .menu-first')
  option_2: $('.quotes .menu-first')
  option_3: $('.quotes, .menu-first')
  option_4: $('.quotes' + '.menu-first')
  question: How can you select the following blockquote AND the list in a single call
    to jQuery() without chaining?
- ans: option_2
  option_1: “fast”
  option_2: “extreme”
  option_3: '2000'
  option_4: “slow”
  question: Effects like show, hide, fadIn, and fadeOut can be called with no arguments,
    but can also take arguments for how long they should last. Which is NOT a duration
    argument supported by these functions?
- ans: option_4
  option_1: $('#dialog').classToggle('bounce')
  option_2: $('#dialog.bounce').removeClass().addClass()
  option_3: $('#dialog').addOrRemoveClass('bounce')
  option_4: $('#dialog').toggleClass('bounce')
  question: Though jQuery offers visual effects, it is considered a best practice
    to use CSS to set up different states triggered by classes, where it makes sense.
    What’s the easiest way to enable and disable a class bounce on an element with
    the ID dialog?
- ans: option_2
  option_1: Selectors are used to refine the content that filters have been applied
    to.
  option_2: Selectors are used to find and select content in a page. Filters are used
    to refine the results of selectors.
  option_3: Filters are used to remove content from the page. Selectors are used to
    add content to the page
  option_4: There is no real difference. They are both used to build up lists of page
    content.
  question: What is the main difference between selectors and filters?
- ans: option_3
  option_1: $('#canvas').on('click.right', function(){ console.log('Handled a right-click')
    });
  option_2: $('#canvas').on('contextual', function(){ console.log('Handled a right-click')
    });
  option_3: $('#canvas').on('contextmenu', function(){ console.log('Handled a right-click')
    });

    code?
- ans: option_2
  option_1: $('p').count()
  option_2: $('p').length
  option_3: $('*').find('p')
  option_4: $('p').length()
  question: What is the correct way to check how many paragraphs exist on a page using
    jQuery?
- ans: option_4
  option_1: At Point 1, this means a jQuery object. At Point 2, it means a DOM element.
  option_2: 'In this case, they mean the same thing: a jQuery object.'
  option_3: 'In this case, they mean the same thing: a DOM element.'
  option_4: At Point 1, this means a DOM element. At Point 2, it means a jQuery object.
  question: As with many areas of JavaScript, keeping track of the meaning of this
    is important and sometimes tricky. What does this mean at each of the two points
    in this custom plugin snippet?
- ans: option_4
  option_1: " $('.menu-first > li')\n.eq(0)\n.css('font-weight', 'bold')\n.eq(1)\n\
    .css('font-style', 'oblique');\n \n"
  option_2: " $('.menu-first > li')\n.first()\n.css('font-weight', 'bold')\n.after()\n\
    .css('font-style', 'oblique');\n \n"
  option_3: " $('.menu-first > li')\n.first()\n.css('font-weight', 'bold')\n.second()\n\

  question: How can you make the first list item bold and the next item oblique, in
    a single statement chain?
- ans: option_4
  option_1: You cannot use multiple class selectors such as .class1.class2.
  option_2: You cannot use pseudo-classes such as :not or :last-of-type.
  option_3: 'You cannot use IDs and classes together, such as #element.class.'
  option_4: None. All CSS selectors are compatible in jQuery.
  question: Which CSS selectors can you NOT use in jQuery?
- ans: option_2
  option_1: event.capture();
  option_2: event.stopPropagation();
  option_3: event.preventDefault();
  option_4: event.stop();
  question: Starting with some DOM elements in the nested structure below, you assign
    listeners for the same event to a child element and one of the parents using the
    JavaScript that follows. You want to ensure that when .leaf is clicked, only its
    event handler will be fired, instead of the click bubbling up and also firing
    the parent’s click handler. What do you need to add to its handler function?
- ans: option_4
  option_1: $($target.get(0) + ':image')
  option_2: $('img').is($target)
  option_3: $target.filter('img')
  option_4: $target.is('img')
  question: Using event delegation, you can listen for events on a lot of different
    items without having to attach separate listeners to each one. But there are times
    when you may want to check the type of item receiving the event before doing anything,
    such as checking if an image was clicked versus a text field. Given the starter
    code below, which choice shows what jQuery provides to help with that process?
- ans: option_3
  option_1: " $(\"#elements\").append($('<p class=\"appended\">As an HTML string</p>'));\n\
    \ \n"
  option_2: " var p = document.createElement('p');\nvar text = document.createTextNode('As\
    \ a DOM element');\np.appendChild(text);\n$(\"#elements\").append(p);\n \n"
  option_3: " $(\"#elements\").append(<p class=\"appended\">As a JSX object</p>);\n\
    \ \n"
  option_4: " $(\"#elements\").append($('<p>', {\n\"class\": 'appended',\n'text':\
    \ \"As an attribute object\"\n}));\n \n"
  question: There are many ways to create elements that can be added to the page.
    Which answer is NOT one of those ways, assuming you have the following on the
    page?
- ans: option_4
  option_1: 'It adds the first class found on the body element to the #menu element.'
  option_2: 'It adds all classes found on the #menu element to the body tag.'
  option_3: 'It replaces any classes on the #menu element with all classes from the
    body tag.'
  option_4: 'It adds all classes found on the body element to the #menu element.'
  question: The .addClass() and .removeClass() methods can accept functions as arguments.
    What does this function do?
- ans: option_3
  option_1: Install the newer version of jQuery, go through each script one by one,
    and fix what looks broken.
  option_2: Read the change notes for the newer version of jQuery, fix all scripts,
    install the newer version, and fix anything that remains broken.
  option_3: Install the newer version of jQuery as well as its Migrate plugin, fix
    all warnings, and uninstall the Migrate plugin.
  option_4: Install the newer version of jQuery at the same time, and use jQuery.noConflict()
    on pages that need the older version.
  question: You’re working on a site that uses an old version of jQuery, and you want
    to update to a newer version. What’s the most efficient way to do so?
- ans: option_2
  option_1: $('a').attribute('href', 'http://www.example.com')
  option_2: $('a').attr('href', 'http://www.example.com')
  option_3: $('a').data('href', 'http://www.example.com')
  option_4: $('a').href('http://www.example.com')
  question: Let’s say you have a page with just one link on it. How can you change
    the anchor tag so it links to example.com?
- ans: option_1
  option_1: It is an alias to the main core method of jQuery itself—the same as writing
    jQuery().
  option_2: It is a utility function that selects the first element from the document.
  option_3: It is a shorter way to write document.getElementById().
  option_4: It is a utility function that selects the last element from the document.
  question: What does $() mean in jQuery?
- ans: option_4
  option_1: jQuery.each, a general purpose iterator for looping over arrays or objects
  option_2: jQuery.isNumeric, which can check whether its argument is, or looks like,
    a number
  option_3: jQuery.extend, which can merge objects and make complete deep copies of
    objects
  option_4: jQuery.isMobile, which can tell whether the user is using a mobile browser
  question: Along with DOM traversal and manipulation, jQuery offers several general-purpose
    helper functions that fill in some JavaScript gaps, especially before ES2015.
    Which is NOT a jQuery utility function?
- ans: option_2
  option_1: $('checkbox').val(/sun/);
  option_2: $('input[value*="sun"]');
  option_3: $('input[value|="sun"]');
  option_4: $('input:checkbox').attr('value', '*sun*');
  question: Given this set of checkboxes, how can you select the ones that have the
    phrase “sun” as part of the value?
- ans: option_4
  option_1: Set the type option to “none”.
  option_2: Set the processData option to false.
  option_3: Set a success callback that returns false.
  option_4: Set the option “global” to false.
  question: How can you get an AJAX request to go through without triggering any of
    jQuery’s AJAX events?
- ans: option_2
  option_1: $.val('.form-item', '555-1212');
  option_2: $('.form-item').val('555-1212');
  option_3: $('.form-item').data('value', '555-1212');
  option_4: $('.form-item').set('value', '555-1212');
  question: How do you change the current value of a text field with the class .form-item
    to “555-1212”?
- ans: option_4
  option_1: $('body').ajaxComplete(function() { console.count('An AJAX request completed');
    });
  option_2: $(document).on('ajax-complete', function() { console.count('An AJAX request
    completed'); });
  option_3: $('body').on('ajaxComplete', function() { console.count('An AJAX request
    completed'); });
  option_4: $(document).ajaxComplete(function() { console.count('An AJAX request completed');
    });
  question: How would you fire a callback when any AJAX request on a page has completed?
- ans: option_1
  option_1: $('input[value="blimp"]');
  option_2: $('input[value!="blimp"]');
  option_3: $('checkbox').val('blimp');
  option_4: $('input:checkbox').attr('value', 'blimp');
  question: Given this set of checkboxes, how can you select the one with the value
    “blimp”?
- ans: option_3
  option_1: It makes all the menu items bold.
  option_2: It throws an exception on line 3.
  option_3: It makes the first set of menu items, not the second, bold.
  option_4: It makes the second set of menu items, not the first, bold.
  question: Given this snippet of HTML and jQuery code, what does the jQuery do?
- ans: option_4
  option_1: jQuery does not support ems and will make the type 1 pixel larger instead
    of 1 em larger.
  option_2: jQuery cannot override CSS in a style attribute, so the font size will
    not change.
  option_3: The font size was set with a shorthand property, so jQuery will not animate
    the font size at all.
  option_4: The font size was set with a shorthand property, so jQuery will start
    the animation from 0 instead of from 1 em.
  question: You want to take a block of type and animate it to a larger size with
    jQuery. The following HTML and JavaScript behaves strangely. What is the issue?
- ans: option_2
  option_1: The clone() function may ignore data attributes on the original elements.
  option_2: The clone() function may result in elements with duplicate ID attributes.
  option_3: The clone() function may remove CSS classes from the cloned elements.
  option_4: The clone() function may not respect the attribute order of the original
    elements.
  question: When using the clone() function to duplicate an element, what is one of
    the main concerns your code needs to watch out for?
- ans: option_1
  option_1: The jQuery script tag must come first, followed by the plugin, followed
    by your custom scripts, all preferably at or near the bottom of the page.
  option_2: Your custom scripts must appear first in the document <head>, followed
    by jQuery, followed by the plugin.
  option_3: The jQuery script tag and the plugin script tag must appear in the document
    <head>, and your custom scripts can follow anywhere on the page.
  option_4: The jQuery script tag must appear in the document <head>, but the plugin
    and your custom scripts can appear anywhere else in any order.
  question: When incorporating a plugin into a project, what are the important steps
    for basic installation and usage?
- ans: option_1
  option_1: The code inside them can manipulate the DOM safely, knowing the browser
    has loaded it fully.
  option_2: The code inside them can manipulate images on the page safely, knowing
    they have fully downloaded to the browser.
  option_3: The code inside them will be run exactly once per user session.
  option_4: The code inside them is not aware of the DOM.
  question: These two script tags show different ways of using jQuery’s ready() method.
    What is true about both approaches?
- ans: option_2
  option_1: self
  option_2: target
  option_3: object
  option_4: source
  question: Which property of the jQuery event object references the DOM object that
    dispatched an event?
- ans: option_4
  option_1: jQuery optimizes the DOM in a background thread, making updates faster.
  option_2: jQuery avoids using the DOM at all.
  option_3: jQuery uses a virtual DOM that batches updates, making inserts and deletes
    faster.
